# HCRImageAnalysis
These scripts enable high throughput image processing for quantifying integrated fluorescence intensity signal normalized by cell density (estimated from paired DAPI images) 

The code presented is entirely written in MATLAB and its use requires installation of the Image Processing Toolbox Library. 

Outputted data can be copied over from the IntensityArray variable for manipulation into the user's statistical analysis software of choice. 

Algorithm for estimating counts of nuclei was developed further from a basic script hosted on the MATLAB File Exchange (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45174-nuclei-counter) by user, 'naive' (Last update posted Jan 21,2014)
